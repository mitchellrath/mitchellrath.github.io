  I am a health data scientist by training, with an academic background in genetic biology and biostatistics. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science and Analytics with the University of Calgary, due to graduate in 2021.<br>
  I have been developing a career in healthcare research, combining my undergraduate and graduate training in a research position conducting data analysis & research coordination in a pediatric clinical setting. <br> 
  Included in this page are some select projects I have worked on throughout my academic training and career.
